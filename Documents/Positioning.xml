        <para>Vertex positions are perhaps the most important part of a vertex's information. The
            only data that a vertex shader must produce is the computation of a clip-space vertex
            position; everything else is user-defined.</para>
        <para>Computing proper vertex positions can turn an assemblage of triangles into something
            that resembles a real object. This section of the book will detail how to make objects
            move around, as well as presenting them as a three-dimensional object. It covers how to
            manipulate vertex positions through a series of spaces, to allow for concepts like a
            change of viewer orientation. And it covers how to position and orient objects
            arbitrarily, to achieve many different kinds of movement and animation.</para>
