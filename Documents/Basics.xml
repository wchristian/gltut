        <para>Graphics programming can be a daunting task when starting out. The rendering pipeline
            involves a large number of steps, each dealing with a variety of math operations. It has
            stages that run actual programs to compute results for the next. Mastering this
            pipeline, being able to use it as a tool to achieve a visual effect, is the essence of
            being a graphics programmer.</para>
        <para>This section of the book will introduce the basic math necessary for 3D graphics. It
            will introduce the rendering pipeline as defined by OpenGL. And it will demonstrate how
            data flows through the graphics pipeline.</para>
