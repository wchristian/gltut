        <para>One of the most important aspects of rendering is lighting. Thus far, all of our
            objects have had a color that is entirely part of the mesh data, pulled from a
            uniform variable, or computed in an arbitrary way. This makes all of our objects
            look very flat and unrealistic.</para>
        <para>Properly modeling the interaction between light and a surface is vital in creating a
            convincing world. Lighting defines how we see and understand shapes to a large degree.
            The lack of lighting is the reason why the objects we have used thus far look fairly
            flat. A curved surface appears curved to us because of how the light plays over the
            surface. The same goes for a flat surface.</para>
        <para>Without this visual hinting, surfaces appear flat even when they are modeled with many
            triangles and yield a seemingly-curved polygonal mesh. A proper lighting model makes
            objects appear real. A poor or inconsistent lighting model shows the virtual world to be
            the forgery that it is.</para>
        <para>This section of the book will cover lighting, using a variety of light/surface
            modelling techniques. It will cover dynamic range and linear colorspaces in lighting
            equations. Also, it will cover techniques to use lighting to produce entirely fake
            surfaces.</para>
