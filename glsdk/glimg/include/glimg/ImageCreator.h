	\brief A factory object for creating ImageSet objects.

	Creating a valid ImageSet is a complicated task. To ensure the validity and veracity of data
	for ImageSet objects, the task of creating them is managed by this factory object.

	This object can be copy constructed (but not copy-assigned), which will copy all of the
	pixel data uploaded thus far.

	The ImageFormat given to this class's constructor serves double-duty. It will be the ImageFormat that
	the resulting ImageSet gets, but it also describes the expected arrangement of any pixel data given
	to the object. This includes the \em alignment part of the ImageFormat.

	Since ImageCreator is designed to be used with OpenGL, it can flip any incoming pixel data written to it.
	If you send image data in top-left coordinates, it will flip the pixels to bottom-left. This \em includes
	compressed textures.
