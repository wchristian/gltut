	/**
	\brief Specifies the bitdepth for each component of each pixel.

	Each component of each pixel has a particular bitdepth. The bitdepths specified here
	are either per-component or specify the size of an entire pixel. The PER_COMP
	enumerators specify the size of each component.

	So if PER_COMP_16 is used with a RGB format, then each pixel takes up 48 bits.
	This could be using integers (shorts) or floats (half-floats). Whether it is
	16-bit integers or 16-bit floats is determined by the PixelDataType.

	The PACKED enumerators are for formats where each component does not have
	the same bitdepth. The number after PACKED specifies the overall bitdepth
	of the pixel. PACKED_16_BIT means that the pixel takes up 16 bits.
	The numbers after represent the bitdepth of the individual components, in the order
	specified by the ComponentOrder enumerator.

	PACKED formats that end in "_REV" reverse the order of the components. So 1555_REV
	means that the lowest 5 bits are the first component, the next 5 are the second, 
	the 5 after that are the third, and the highest bit is the fourth component.
