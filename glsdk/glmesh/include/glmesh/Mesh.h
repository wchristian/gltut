	\brief An object that represents a static collection of mesh data.

	Mesh objects are created to represent static data, where Draw and its ilk are used for more dynamic
	or simple objects.

	Mesh objects are composed of a VAO (which sets up all of the vertex attribute commands),
	coupled with a series of rendering commands, provided by a RenderCmdList.
	
	A Mesh can have multiple VAOs, each of which has a unique name. These named VAOs
	are called variants. The main VAO, which is unnamed, . All of the variants are rendered
	with the same sequence of rendering commands.

	This object owns the VAOs it is provided with, and it will delete them. It can also be given
	ownership of one or more buffer objects, which it will also delete when it is deleted. It does not
	use these buffer objects for any purpose other than to delete them.
	
	This class cannot be copied.

	Rendering with this class (via any call to Render) will affect the following OpenGL state:

	\li The current VAO binding. After the call, it will be reset to 0.
	\li The current GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART enable. After the call, it will be disabled.

	\note: This class requires the presence of ARB_vertex_array_object or OpenGL 3.0 or above.

	\note: You must ensure that the OpenGL context exists when this Mesh's is called.
