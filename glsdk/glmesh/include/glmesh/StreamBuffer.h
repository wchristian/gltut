	\brief A class for streaming vertex data to buffer objects on the GPU.

	This class is specifically used for efficiently streaming vertex data to the GPU. It
	can map some part of the buffer, invalidate the buffer, and so forth. It also stores a convenient
	vertex array object, if VAO's are available.

	The StreamBuffer has the concept of a current position within the buffer. Each time the buffer
	is finished being mapped, the current position is advanced by the space that was mapped;
	the assumption being that you have written to all of the data requested. The user can ask
	how much space is left in the StreamBuffer.

	Invalidating the buffer resets the current position.

	StreamBuffer cannot be copied, as performing a deep-copy would not be a reasonably fast operation.
