	/**
	\brief Mouse-based control over the orientation and position of an object.

	This Pole speaks of three spaces: local, world, and view. Local refers to the coordinate system
	of vertices given to the matrix that this Pole generates. World represents the \em output coordinate
	system. So vertices enter in local and are transformed to world. Note that this does not have
	to actually be the real world-space. It could be the space of some parent hierarchy, but
	the ObjectPole is not really designed for that.
	
	View represents the space provided by the ViewProvider given to the constructor. The assumption
	that this Pole makes when using the view space matrix is that the matrix the ObjectPole
	generates will be multiplied by the view matrix given by the ViewProvider. So it is assumed
	that there is no intermediate space.

	This Pole is given an action button, which it will listen for click events from. When
	the action button is held down and the mouse moved, the object's orientation will change,
	relative to the orientation of the view. But only if a ViewProvider (such as ViewPole) was
	provided; otherwise, the rotation will be relative to the world.
	
	If no modifier keys (shift, ctrl, alt) were held when the click was given, then the object will be
	oriented in both the view-space X and Y axes. If the CTRL key is held when the click was given, then
	the object will only rotate around either the X or Y axis. The selection is based on whether
	the X or the Y mouse coordinate is farthest from the initial position when dragging started.
	If the ALT key is held, then the object will rotate about the Z axis, and only the X position
	of the mouse affects the object.

	More information on \ref module_glutil_poles "mouse poles is available."

	/**
	\brief Mouse-based control over the orientation and position of the camera. 
	
	This view controller is based on a target point, which is centered in the camera, and an
	orientation around that target point that represents the camera. The Pole allows the user
	to rotate around this point, move closer to/farther from it, and to move the point itself.

	This Pole is given a ViewDef that defines a number of size parameters and limitations.

	This Pole is given an action button, which it will listen for click events from. If the
	mouse button is clicked and no modifiers are pressed, the the view will rotate
	around the object in both the view-local X and Y axes. If the CTRL key is held, then it
	will rotate about the X or Y axes, based on how far the mouse is from the starting point in the
	X or Y directions. If the ALT key is held, then the camera will spin in the view-local Z direction.

	Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down moves the camera closer or farther from the object, respectively.
	The distance is taken from ViewDef::largeRadiusDelta. If the SHIFT key is held while scrolling, then the
	movement will be the ViewDef::smallRadiusDelta value instead.

	The target point can be moved, relative to the current view, with the WASD keys. W/S move forward and
	backwards, while A/D move left and right, respectively. Q and E move down and up, respectively. If
	the \a bRightKeyboardCtrls parameter of the constructor is set, then it uses the IJKLUO keys instead
	of WASDQE. The offset applied to the position is ViewDef::largePosOffset; if SHIFT is held,
	then ViewDef::smallPosOffset is used instead.
