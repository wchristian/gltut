	/**
	\brief Implements a stack for glm::mat4 transformations.

	A matrix stack is a sequence of transforms which you can preserve and restore as needed. The
	stack has the concept of a "current matrix", which can be retrieved with the Top() function.
	The top matrix can even be obtained as a float array. The pointer returned will remain valid until
	this object is destroyed (though its values will change). This is useful for uploading matrices
	to OpenGL via glUniformMatrix4fv.

	The other functions will right-multiply a transformation matrix with the current matrix, thus
	changing the current matrix.

	The main power of the matrix stack is the ability to preserve and restore matrices in a stack fashion.
	The current matrix can be preserved on the stack with Push() and the most recently preserved matrix
	can be restored with Pop(). You must ensure that you do not Pop() more times than you Push(). Also,
	while this matrix stack does not have an explicit size limit, if you Push() more times than you Pop(),
	then you can eventually run out of memory (unless you create and destroy the MatrixStack every frame).

	The best way to manage the stack is to never use the Push() and Pop() methods directly.
	Instead, use the PushStack object to do all pushing and popping. That will ensure that
	overflows and underflows cannot not happen.

		-Z axis, so objects with larger negative Z values are farther away. +Y is up and +X is to the right.
